@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov @trvrb .@DrTedros  has started the conversation about how we avoid the next pandemic which is important. I appreciate your work on this. We can do a lot better next time!!#
@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov A more transmissive variant is not likely but we have been surprised a lot during this pandemic. Omicron will create a lot of immunity at least for the next year. @trvrb  tracks the genetics really well. We may have to take yearly shots for Covid for some time.
@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov As countries experience their Omicron wave health systems will be challenged. Most of the severe cases will be unvaccinated people. Once Omicron goes through a country then the rest of the year should see far fewer cases so Covid can be treated more like seasonal flu.

@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov The data is pretty strong that it came from another species which is true for most pandemics.

@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov From 2000 to the start of the pandemic we made strong progress on health and other goals. The pandemic is a huge setback - including rich countries not focusing on the needs of developing countries as much. I hope we can reverse that.

@devisridhar @gavi A few countries like Australia moved fast to diagnose cases at scale and isolate people who were infected. They were able to limit deaths dramatically. Once the numbers get large in a country it is too late. So the first few months made a lot of difference.

@devisridhar When we have adequate supply then tiered pricing is used where the rich countries pay a lot more than middle income and low income pay the least which is funded by @gavi. When supply is limited rich countries have to not outbid the others so governments are key to this. #
@devisridhar mRna vaccines still can't meet all the demand so figuring out who gets what is complicated.#
@devisridhar During 2021 the supply of vaccines was limited and they mostly went to wealthy countries. Now we have a lot of supply overall and the problems are logistics and demand. The health systems in developing countries are a limiting factor.
"@devisridhar The vaccines we have prevent severe disease and death very well but they are missing two key things.

First they still allow infections (""breakthrough"") and the duration appears to be limited.

We need vaccines that prevent re-infection and have many years of duration.#"

Mamello Makhele is a hero from Lesotho who traveled by foot and donkey to bring health services to women in need during the pandemic. Her story is nothing short of inspiring: https://t.co/UyI4x0VxhK https://t.co/3MLP5nvm5l
"I know itâ€™s frustrating to go into another holiday season with COVID looming over us. But it wonâ€™t be like this forever. Someday the pandemic will end, and the better we look after each other, the sooner that time will come."
"If thereâ€™s good news here, itâ€™s that omicron moves so quickly that once it becomes dominant in a country, the wave there should last less than 3 months. Those few months could be bad, but I still believe if we take the right steps, the pandemic can be over in 2022."
"There will be more breakthrough cases in people who are vxâ€™d, which sounds concerning but is purely a factor of how many people are vxâ€™d and how fast this variant is spreading. Vaccines are designed to prevent people from getting seriously ill or dying &amp; are doing that well."
"In the meantime, we all have to look out for each other, especially the most vulnerable, whether they live down the street or in another country. That means wearing masks, avoiding big indoor gatherings, and getting vaccinated. Getting a booster gives the best protection."
"The big unknown is how sick omicron makes you. We need to take it seriously until we know more about it. Even if itâ€™s only half as severe as delta, it will be the worst surge we have seen so far because itâ€™s so infectious."
Omicron is spreading faster than any virus in history. It will soon be in every country in the world.
"Just when it seemed like life would return to normal, we could be entering the worst part of the pandemic. Omicron will hit home for all of us. Close friends of mine now have it, and Iâ€™ve canceled most of my holiday plans."

"Inequity in health is not new. Each year, more than 5 million childrenâ€”almost entirely in low- and middle-income countriesâ€”die before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases. Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundationâ€™s top priority for more than 20 years."
