"43,""Likes Great Pacing: Shang Chi lot thing built tale try make origin story fit far movie series. With information, might worry pace off, surprisingly done super well. Never really dragging, moving blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tale keep thing moving flying important element connect characters. The cast get ample time give u backstories, piece together cluse dynamic drama puzzle, sacrifice action come. Character Development: The trailer may thinking modern martial art film, sense would right. However, movie take one step go beyond punch instead give character soul layer compared legendary film past. Shang's life complicated torn light dark, sister well experiencing drama manner parallel main protagonist. Even antagonist layer far beyond normally get Marvel group, I loved well line mixed together make melodramatic family story fit naturally Marvel universe. The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, like me, disappointed show film. Several question answered character's return many laugh manner familiar Marvel fans. The inclusion character also hold important (albeit stretch) plot element give little meaning behind it, I loved choice made include big picture. The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther African Culture, Shang Chi integrates much cultural value Asian province movie. The costume stunning take traditional attire, bringing past light also sewing modern style jazz outfits. Concepts family honor, custom practicing Marshal Arts, honoring family well-integrated story help give predictable tale extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture setting breathes new life typical cityscape made famous Marvel, legend Ten ring scream Asian mythology seeped int heir history. I loved well thing merged Marvel tale, though little predictable flaunting, really elevated origin story stand many others. The CGI Finally Disney invested making movie show studio do. Shan Chi bunch plenty amazing thing overuse computer effect modern era loves. Special effect action scene realism Black Widow executed, creature see lot polish fluidity movements, special effect involving ten ring fluid holding depth I felt missing recent Marvel projects. The Acting: A great part played member film, extra included, Shang Chi's cast show acting dead character utilized well. Simu Liu lead fantastic, campaign movie could ended better results. He hold much prodigal martial artist, disciplined focused avid fighter capable crushing enemy style. However, also troubled layer past watch helped spread emotional spectrum. Awkwafina still cooky role always plays, time get little balance heroism compared character heralded past. I loved well used film, great complemented Simu role. Leung brings lot pizazz character, giving u antagonist much scowl fist, I felt perfect casting play opponent Shang Chi. So many great actor actress film, due time restriction I move on, trust well performances. The Comedy: Awkwafina often used much making u laugh, Disney struggled forcing lot comedy make kid friendly. However, Shang Chi taken step back discipline used comedy well break ice. Dialogue go long way breaking laughs, well-timed joke gag solid punch gut comedy. There several ridiculous inclusion film first seem place, roll back extravagant joke great set up. And throw reference come get shining beacon awesomeness come movie. It's done well I happy results. The Action: My bread butter Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered well film's action expos�. The art choreographed battle brings another homage Asian culture, fantastic fight bite impressive skill use half Marvel cinema. It's exciting, dynamic, fight different feel might expect. Used well story, purpose behind inclusion battle one different meaning stake behind simply punching kicking. Even so, strategy behind required win, accomplishes level storytelling lost modern era, well done too. A Bit More Adult: The movie definitely showing Marvel's modernization 21st century, take risk making film darker adult installments. Cursing definitely increased one, plenty swear word filling dialogue, point overdone. No F bombs, language got little bite, caution. In addition, tone tale darker, sunshine rainbow Thor, Captain America, Guardians left dust grittier tale, plus. Some political moments: While nowhere bad 75% movie today, Shang Chi sometimes get bit preachy agenda politics film. Taking time rub face obvious line stating, """"Look I do,"""" bit showboating I could done without. Yet even dislike marginal, given little occurring, nice moment build it, sometimes fun lesson joke built in. A Little More Action: The action movie great, I loved much flowed accomplished I expecting film, thing I expecting. Yet time moment fighting felt little forced, namely chase scene vehicle seemed like afterthought. However, fight end needed time me, perhaps little bouncing battle occurring time. Star Wars done successfully past, showing manner battling giving big scope battle. Shang Chi done better several Marvel films, still room give u look character kicking butt. The battle lengthy enough, I'll agree that, little showing warrior would rounded fight perfection me. The VERDICT: Shang Chi finally made feel like back realm Marvel I fell love year ago. A cultural building world origin story continuation, hero's quest making fun, exciting swift adventure expecting. Buried beneath amazing fight special effects, deeper movie I expected, using character well integrating serve purpose. Balanced comedy cultural inclusion politics steal away main theme movie, giving adult touch plus book, though caution little one watching it. As limitations, I agree predictability familiarity movie, fresh twist balance help rejuvenate formula add minimize impact limitation me. Though I say little better wider scope battle still needed them. Overall, score film are: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0."",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

Wenwu straight-up evil person still good I like that. Unfortunately, Shang Chi suffers 3 villain problem. Razorfist played Florian Wenwu's henchman get backstory.

The movie perfect, contains trite """"superhero"""" storytelling element Disney movie often rely on, director/writer Destin Daniel Cretton's clear talent behind camera transforms every average scene larger-than-life sequence high stake character easy invest in. The first act film admittedly play similar many mainstream """"hero's journey"""" tale -- average joe (Shang-Chi) turn more-than-average calling must return past order keep father evil thing might cause many innocent casualties. It seems like combination idea done before. The movie weakest set interesting concept plot, SHANG-CHI, gold execution storyline. Firstly, character interesting start movie end, despite clich�s audience still care happens every character, including fantastic villains. The comedic relief also point throughout, character feel personable colorful due life actor put performances. Simi Liu Shang-Chi star making, similar Chris Evans' turn first Captain America film, casting director Hollywood likely near top call list this. The performance film me, however, Tony Leung Shang-Chi's father primary villain. Leung play one lived-in memorable MCU villain since Erik Killmonger -- impossible feel sympathy even though clear serious issue dealing inner demons. At end day, I believe SHANG-CHI truly remembered technical mastery put action sequences. Only time tell statement remains true, struck watching: film contains well-filmed action sequence live-action Marvel movie thus far. A high-stakes fight scene bus 20-30 minute movie made realize filmmaker messing around action: stunt choreography phenomenal, visual effect cinematography stunning, action set piece inventive pay homage great Asian cinema past. The final 30 minute SHANG-CHI involve one large final battle, rank one favorite final fight scene MCU along Avengers: Endgame Infinity War. SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS perfect, especially looking complete reinvention mean superhero movie. It adheres many standard already set genre, stylish sleek way difficult smile much film. Cretton fantastic job helming movie way set apart project came it, end crafting Avatar: The Last Airbender movie I wish had. Superhero movie may running ideas, continue crafted well, expect see plenty came from.

"337,""Disclaimer: I watched Spanish dubbed version film. Therefore, I unable provide criticism original actors' acting film. Shang-Chi hit! One favorite Marvel film sure. While indeed take place MCU, feel like Marvel films, good way, is. Our protagonist real superpowers, cheesy, outlandish fictional element characteristic many Marvel film exchanged mystical, creative elements. As another reviewer put it, almost film belonged Harry Potter universe MCU. The story revolves around Shaun (Simu Liu) friend Katy (Awkwafina), two young valet driver living San Francisco. After rather exhilarating episode bus work group men steal Shaun's jade pendant, decides visit sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) China warn they'll going next. Katy insists joining, plane ride, Shaun reveals true identity back story: Shang-Chi, great martial art warrior China whose father Xu Wenwu (brilliantly cast Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) posse titular legendary ring (which actually like bracelets, ask me), give god-like power immortality. They wrap around forearm glow bright blue, seem mystical magnetic properties. Ever since Shang-Chi sister's mother Li (Fala Chen) died children, father right head developed obsession bracelets. One day start hearing belief wife's voice call him, thus set reunite secret city Ta Lo, hometown hard get to. Our hero must stop open Pandora's box. The visuals film spectacular, especially creative us bright, contrasting colors. What's really neat film first half portrays modern Chinese culture second half portrays traditional Chinese culture. You get best worlds, will. I expert Chinese culture, means, film made way I believe respect it. The film also make use Mandarin language time time (particularly flashbacks), give sense authenticity Chinese character speak English time. I slight criticism. In Avengers Endgame, extremely cheesy cringeworthy scene near end female character shown side side, Black character shown side side, etc. The rather random appearance character Wong movie le extension scene. It's Kevin Feige (or perhaps director Destin Daniel Cretton) said, """"Oh. We new Shang-Chi movie featuring mostly Asian cast. Let's throw Wong Dr. Strange he's Asian."""" It's realistic show character different race working together, sends better message well. In way Black Panther feature mostly Black cast, Marvel want make previous exclusion Asian character cramming many one movie. We see future store Shang-Chi character color MCU. Overall, I really can't complain much film. Some special effect (in particular """"blast"""" sound effect attributed rings) top, CGI general stellar, setting costume fun fresh. The fight scene particular great. The presence character Katy bit clich� superhero genre; felt lot like equivalent Peter Parker's friend Ned Tom Holland Spiderman movies. That is, really serf purpose protagonist's best friend capable thing otherwise capable doing, sake plot. It would cool Shang-Chi instead sensei-like teacher guide (as case Liam Nesson's Raz al Ghul Batman Begins), I guess role played dad flashback scenes. After all, really origin story. I also would liked see Shang-Chi's sister, get nearly much screen time character development does. Some humor fell flat, but, I said disclaimer, I watched Spanish dubbed version, maybe actually funnier original English. In conclusion, Shang-Chi exceeded expectations, I likely watching near future."",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

Something I've noticed Chinese cinema past 2 decade use slow Mo try poignant emotional. It's overdone, especially slightly cheesey background music labour point. ShangChi lean heavily several time I found rolling eye once. Admittedly may notice it. B. The CGI. I thought great, particularly start forest fight bus scene.

They tried shoehorn couple thing honestly kinda like impression westerner would 'Eastern history culture'. It reminded little bit Marvel The Ancient One (a Caucasian lady Asian clothes), way Danny Rand tried spout mystical phrase Iron Fist. D. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh Yuen Wah.

I would liked seen latter honest would recommend check him, Jackie, Sammo Hung Yuan Biao YouTube. E. The fight scenes. Overall good, particularly hand hand bus (before CGI).

Seeing new Marvel showing come crave fan everyone more. Especially concept Ten Rings. The mysticism spiritual material displayed brilliantly. Fantasy peak. The CGI just.. flawless usual. Works tooo damn neat. The bad aspect movie I consider Wenvu's (Leung) unsatisfactory agenda. He's clearly brilliant intimidating villian agenda, seems nothing Delusional guy. The Wong Abomination arc shown trailer fails deliver justice. The guy, say """"Death Dealer"""" supposed prominent badass, wasted potential. And Marvel can't keep re-using formula """"Big Third Act"""", """"Good vs. Evil"""", load CGI, use start giving new screenplay climax. (also last thing Katy sudden Hawkeye climax just.. facepalm.
